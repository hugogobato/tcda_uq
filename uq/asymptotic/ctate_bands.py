"""Pointwise-in-x confidence bands for the CTATE tau_d(., x).

The *simplest defensible* confidence UQ for the conditional-mean silhouette
effect: a band that is **simultaneous over t** at a **fixed x** (pointwise in x).
Honest *uniform* inference over ``(t, x)`` -- simultaneous bands over the whole
covariate space at nonparametric rate in ``x`` -- is deliberately deferred as a
topology-agnostic extension.

Construction (reuses the multiplier bootstrap conditionally). The
functional DR-learner is a linear smoother of the pseudo-outcome curves,

    tau_hat_d(., x) = sum_i a_i(x) * P psi_{i,d},

so at a fixed x its sampling fluctuation is the linear functional
``sum_i a_i(x) (psi_{i,d} - tau_d(., X_i))`` of the (conditionally) mean-zero
pseudo-outcome residuals. We estimate the residuals by the second-stage
residual curves ``r_{i,d}`` and calibrate a simultaneous-in-t band with a wild
(multiplier) bootstrap of

    G_d(t) = sum_i a_i(x) xi_i r_{i,d}(t),    xi_i iid mean 0 var 1,

a heteroskedasticity-robust (HC0) construction. Let ``s(t) = sqrt(sum_i
a_i(x)^2 r_{i,d}(t)^2)`` be its pointwise sd and ``c_{1-alpha}`` the conditional
``1-alpha`` quantile of ``sup_t |G_d(t)| / s(t)`` (studentized; the default) or
of ``sup_t |G_d(t)|`` (unstudentized, constant width). The band is

    tau_hat_d(., x)  +/-  c_{1-alpha} * s(t)   (studentized)   or   +/- c_{1-alpha}.

Because ``a_i`` already carries the ``1/n`` smoother scale, the half-width
vanishes at the ``1/sqrt(n)`` rate: this is a **confidence** band for the mean
curve tau_d(., x), not a prediction band for an individual (that is Phase 5).
In the marginal case (intercept-only design, ``a_i = 1/n``, ``r_i`` the centered
EIF) it reduces to the TATE multiplier band.

Documented approximations (kept honest): the band treats the linear-in-features
second stage as the working conditional-mean model and uses the HC0 residual
variance; it therefore ignores (i) second-stage smoothing bias if tau_d(., x) is
not linear in the chosen features and (ii) the smaller-order stage-1 nuisance-
estimation error. Under a well-specified second stage (e.g. the tri-oracle,
whose tau is linear in x) these vanish and coverage is ~nominal.
